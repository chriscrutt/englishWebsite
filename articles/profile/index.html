                    <p class="lead drop-cap">I love the sweet thrill of trading Bitcoin. The fact that it is not regulated and fluctuates greatly in price just got me excited and kept me entertained. It’s also, if you have a little more money
                        invested, really stressful. I didn’t have much free money to throw away when I first started trading, so when I put money into Bitcoin, although little, I stressed balls. I checked the price every time I looked at my phone,
                        and would spend lots of time selling and then buying again, trying to make money on the small ups and downs of the market.</p>

                    <p>This, to say the least, was not good for my mental health, so I decided to look at some trading bots that would buy and sell Bitcoin for me, without me needing to stress out all the time. Flash-forward to today, I met someone
                        on the board for the Cal Poly Entrepreneurs club who had some experience interning at a company attempting to predict the price trend of Bitcoin. Although at this point I didn’t have any Bitcoin because of bad decisions I had
                        made in the past, I was still a big enthusiast. Once we started talking I couldn’t help but to see why he was the perfect example for the self made man.
                    </p>

                    <h2>I Was Super Excited to Learn About It</h2>
                    <p>The first step I wanted to take was purchasing Bitcoin, because who needs to research what you're investing in, right? The only issue was the fact that I was 14 and didn’t have access to any money. So, I spent many hours
                        searching for solutions on how I could acquire it without a debit card or even for free. It was very entertaining; I felt like I was soaking up the knowledge of the Bitcoin Gods. Then, something called a Bitcoin Faucet came
                        up. These Faucets give you Bitcoin for “free”, every hour or so. But we know there’s no such things as a free lunch. The Faucet websites were riddled with ads. Everywhere you clicked would take you to another website — most of
                        them were NSFW— which was a mixture of scary and “exciting” as a freshman. I guess the advertisements are their only source of income, and the more clicks they get, the more money they make. But after usually the 8th attempt,
                        you would be relieved to find that a fraction of a cent in Bitcoin is now yours.</p>

                    <h2>Dice Gambling</h2>
                    <p>Some faucets would let you guess over or under a certain value of two rolled dice. Of course, the odds were terrible, but if it would keep me entertained, I’d do it. It was actually pretty fun to try and figure out algorithms
                        to beat the
                        computer and win some money. The saddest part was when my mom would come into my room every so often to see if I was doing my homework, or how far along I was. As soon as I heard those footsteps approaching you’d think I was
                        the fastest man alive. Switching tabs to my school website, pulling out my half done math homework, grabbing a pencil, and hovering it over my papers, pretending to be hard at work. She felt so bad for me, she’d say something
                        like, “Honey, why is it taking you six hours to finish your homework? Is everything okay?” Yes mom it is now go away. I felt like I was falling into an endless abyss; I mean I wasn’t necessarily opposed to it, but once I
                        started something, I couldn’t stop. And once I finished it, I would fall into the next thing, and the next thing. I started going to bed very late and have to wake up early for school the next day and sleep into the late
                        afternoon on weekends, but what can I say; I was in the honeymoon stage of my Bitcoin affair.</p>

                    <p>
                        <img src="/images/faucet-1000.png" srcset="/images/faucet-2000.png 2000w, /images/faucet-1000.png 1000w, /images/faucet-500.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" alt="">
                    </p>

                    <h2>I Tried to Make My Own</h2>
                    <p>If I couldn’t make money using faucets, maybe I could by letting others use mine? Well, it turns out coding a website from scratch with a small amount of programming knowledge isn’t the smartest thing to do. Trying to create a
                        Faucet that dispenses Bitcoin on top of that? Impossible. Plus I didn’t really think about the Faucet needing an extensive amount of starting Bitcoin in order to reward its users. After some grey hairs and ground teeth, I did
                        eventually make a website, but I just couldn’t figure out how to account for Bitcoin. I still have the files for the website on my computer just in case I decide to take it up again. But for now, I had to find a more plausible
                        way to get Bitcoin.</p>

                    <h2>I Found It</h2>
                    <p>Who would have thought Bitcoin had to be generated? I always believed there was a fixed amount and people just traded it around trying to make money on the bull or bear markets. But the Bitcoin community called the term
                        “Mining”. At this point I had been completely consumed by this stupid yet amazing coin that there was no possible way to escape from it, so, I went further into research. Figuring out how Bitcoin actually worked was probably
                        the hardest challenge my 14-year-old self had faced yet, and I loved it. It turns out that Bitcoin Mining is a computational “excavation” of millions of values per second until a certain random value is reached. The first one
                        to find this value receives a “block” of Bitcoin. And believe me when I say, that’s the simplified version of what’s happening. Mining Bitcoin is a lot like mining for real gold, except instead of pickaxes there are computers.
                        Also, like mining, the better pickaxe you have, the more efficient you can be digging for gold — and my pickaxe wasn’t very good. I knew I had no chance against the millions of other computers much better equipped than my
                        dad's very old hand-me-down laptop.</p>

                    <p>
                        <img src="/images/cpuMine-1000.png" srcset="/images/cpuMine-2000.png 2000w, /images/cpuMine-1000.png 1000w, /images/cpuMine-500.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" alt="">
                    </p>

                    <h2>Never Give Up Hope</h2>
                    <p>My research efforts finally forced the internet to yield yet more information on how to acquire Bitcoin via mining — pooling resources with other fellow “Bitcoiners”. Due to so many people trying to mine Bitcoin at the same
                        time, the odds for the individual person was very small, however, if there are a few hundred thousand people all pooling their resources together to mine, your chances increase greatly. And after a block is mined by a Pool, it
                        would be split up depending on who contributed the most processing power. Now instead of earning half a cent every week with Faucets, I’m earning a half a cent every. single. day. I was ecstatic. While this was a major ego
                        boost at home, I still felt alone at school. So, I set to work on fixing that issue too. Of course, I couldn’t just try to talk to people and make new friends, I doubt they wanted to chat anyways, so I thought taking to the
                        library computers was a much better solution. How could I make use of these to my Bitcoin advantage? Well, mining again of course.</p>

                    <h2>The More The Merrier</h2>
                    <p>I sat down at the first library computer and looked up ways I could download a miner onto it. But the school’s firewall kept blocking all the sources I used to download the miners! Every failure only encouraged me to search
                        deeper. When I finally successfully downloaded a miner on one of the computers, it was immediately deleted by the school’s security software. I only cried a little. But there had to be a way. I mean, a half a cent a day is
                        nice, but with the nine extra computers in the library, I could be making an entire five! Then, an epiphany struck me. I could download the miner onto a USB thumb drive, so when I plugged it into the library computers, it
                        wouldn’t delete the software; MY PLAN WORKED! I double-clicked on the miner app and it started running all on its own. I literally couldn’t contain myself. I went that entire day with a seriously smug look on my face, and went
                        in every day after that, tediously turning on each computer, plugging in my USB, running the miner, and then signing out of each one. But it was so worth it. The librarian even came up to me one day and thanked me for coming
                        in every morning and turning on the computers, which made me kind of laugh about how dorky I was being, but I didn’t care; I was making 5 cents a day… or so I thought. What I didn’t realize, was that the computers had stopped
                        mining when I signed out.</p>

                    <p>
                        <img src="/images/mine-1000.png" srcset="/images/mine-2000.png 2000w, /images/mine-1000.png 1000w, /images/mine-500.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" alt="">
                    </p>

                    <h2>A New Issue</h2>
                    <p>I devised a way I could sign out without quitting any of the processes I was running before that. I could run miners and then do a command which simply exited to the sign-in screen on all the computers. The miners would run all
                        day until they were shut off after school by the librarian. I ran into my room the second I got home and finally saw my processing rate up 1,000 percent. I had won.
                    </p>

                    <p>Bitcoin really saved my Freshman year of high school. I had new confidence, talked to more people, and made some new friends. I didn’t feel so abandoned anymore and grew out of my self-pity. I was even starting to have fun in
                        school. After, I continued on with my life feeling just a little higher. The impact of this simple story led me to this for my senior quote, “What seems the smallest of choices often lead down the furthest roads.” I had made
                        the choice to pursue something and stuck with it, and it has changed my life forever. It doesn’t start with something big happening to you, it starts with the small things you work for to get there.</p>

                        <p>This is supposed to be a paragraph of text but honestly I did and don't have the mental capacity at this point to write
                            something constructive that would blow everyones' minds. However, If you are reading this, I hope you are
                            enjoying yourself and having a wonderful day or night. On a seperate note, I used anchor as well as produce my high school's
                            daily news show and would always end on a quote. My quote today is - "What seems the smallest choices often lead down the
                            furthest roads" - Have a wonderful day.</p>
